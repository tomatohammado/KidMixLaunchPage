The KidMix platform and playdate scheduler was designed for children by parents. KidMix takes security seriously and requires users to have their identity verified. We ensure all kids are communicating in a private network. &nbsp; KidMix is available on iOS, Android, and Web Browser providing cross platform communication for parents and kids.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1">Beta Testing Defined:</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c2">KidMix is currently in &ldquo;Beta&rdquo; testing. This means that we have not yet completed development of KidMix. Not all features are completely functional or available, and the site or App may perform slowly at times. In some cases, you may see cryptic error messages filled with computer-speak. And occasionally, the site might not work at all. It&rsquo;s important for us to hear from you as you use KidMix. We want to know what you like, don&rsquo;t like, and have questions about. We&rsquo;d like to know how we can make KidMix as useful as possible for you!
