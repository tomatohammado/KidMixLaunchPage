About KidMix:

KidMix is a FREE social network for children to communicate, learn, and share thoughts &
photos with their friends and family. The KidMix platform and playdate scheduler was designed 
for children by parents. KidMix takes security seriously and requires users to have their identity 
verified. We ensure all kids are communicating in a private network. KidMix is available on 
iOS, Android, and Web Browser providing cross platform communication for parents and kids. 
As used in these Terms, third party(ies) are persons or business entities, websites and other 
platforms and any other business or enterprise that is referred to in the context of these 
Terms as being other than KidMix or a user.

Terms of Service

The KidMix Social Network (the “Service”) is comprised of various web pages (any such web 
pages then in use being the “Site”) and software applications (“Application(s)”) operated by 
KidMix, LLC (“KidMix”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). These technologies are offered to you 
conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices 
contained herein (the “Terms”). PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THESE TERMS 
CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU ACCESS THE SERVICE. By accessing or otherwise using the 
Service, you unconditionally accept and agree to be bound by these Terms, whether or not you 
have read them. Please read these terms carefully and keep a copy of them for your reference. 

Operational Issues:

KidMix is currently in “Beta” testing. This means that we have not yet completed development 
of KidMix. Not all features are completely functional or available, and the site or App may 
perform slowly at times. In some cases, you may see cryptic error messages filled with 
computer-speak. And occasionally, the site might not work at all. It’s important for us to hear 
from you as you use KidMix. We want to know what you like, don’t like, and have questions 
about. We’d like to know how we can make KidMix as useful as possible for you! Please email 
us at info@KidMixApp.com or go to http://help.KidMixApp.com to make suggestions, share 
ideas, report problems, or ask a question. In doing so, however, you agree that, in the absence of 
any written agreement to the contrary, KidMix will be free to use any feedback you provide for 
any purpose and you are transferring any right of ownership with respect thereto to us and are 
waiving any right to compensation with respect thereto. We devote significant time to checking 
the feedback we receive!

Please address all operational questions to support@kidmixapp.com. Please understand 
that both while in Beta testing and in full operations mode KidMix cannot ensure or 
guarantee and does not warrant that the Service available through the Site or the 
Applications will be accurate, meet your particular needs or requirements or that the 
Service or the Site or Applications are complete, accurate or current.

legal parent or guardian of a child wishing to use the site in order to sign-up as a Parent and sign-
